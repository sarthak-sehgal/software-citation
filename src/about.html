    <div id="content">
      <p>
        The Software Citation Project started when a group of research software engineers realised that a <i>"chicken and egg"</i> (discussed below) problem exists with citing softwares. The project was discussed in great detail at various sprints and hackathons by researchers and software engineers from all around the globe. The need to solve this problem resonated with the whole community. The project took its shape in the <a href="https://elifesciences.org/labs/fdcb6588/innovation-leaders-2020-introducing-the-cohort" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eLife Innovation Leaders 2020</a> program and is currently managed by <a href="https://sarthaksehgal.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarthak Sehgal</a>.

        Open source softwares, packages, datasets and the alike should be as easily citable as research articles. A common problem the authors of such softwares face is establishing citability to their softwares. Attaching a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Object Identifier (DOI)</a> to your software is highly recommended but it may not be enough. A DOI is a persistent identifier or handle used to identify objects uniquely, standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally, your project should have a DOI to uniquely identify your work and a <a href="https://citation-file-format.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>CITATION.cff</code></a> file which provides rich meta-data and information about citing your software. CITATION.cff files are plain text files with human- and machine-readable citation information for software. Code developers can include them in their repositories to let others know how to correctly cite their software. Read more about the <strong>Citation File Format (CFF)</strong> <a href="https://citation-file-format.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. A <code>CITATION.cff</code> looks like:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The "chicken and egg" problem:</strong> The existing workflow does not allow you to incorporate a DOI (using tools like <a href="https://zenodo.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zenodo</a> and <a href="https://www.zotero.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zotero</a>) and a <code>CITATION.cff</code> easily. Zenodo provides you with a DOI for your software once you release the version and upload the release file on Zenodo. Only after obtaining the DOI can you include it in the CFF file. As a result, your GitHub repository might contain the CFF file but it would not be in the release package (as you released the new version before updating your CFF file).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Software Citation Project aims to solve this problem. Using our platform, you can generate a DOI and a CFF file for your upcoming release. Then, once you update the CFF file on your repository, create a release and publish it using Zenodo!
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Coming soon: Publish release using our platform integration with Zenodo!</i>
